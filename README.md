# Stephan-s-Random-Password-Generator



I created this program so that secure, random passwords can be generated with ease. I started by creating a GitHub repo and cloning all of the correct files into my computer. I started by creating all of the variables I would be using to interpret certain things, aswell as creating arrays that would include all of the different numbers, symbols, and letters that would be used. Then, the plethora of if and else if statements began. I created else if statements that would cover every possible combonation that could be answered by the user through the program. This was all within the generatePassword function. Then, I made the password variable into an array, so I could pull the values from my different arrays up top. I then created a for Loop that would randomley pick the strings and numbers from these different arrays, and produce a pasword that was the right amount of characters that the user picked. Next, I made sure to join the password array into a string (I researched how to do this), so the the passoword numbers would show up as text on the screen. Outside of the generatePassword function, I used the writePassword function to generate the password into the text box that I was provided with. In conclusion, this program provides any business or individual with a secure password that they can use to keep themselves hack-free!
